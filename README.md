Blank Application for Y Combinator Winter '17 Batch, good luck

I created this to help keep track of changes of my application answers. Submitted it to Hacker News and turns out a few people found it useful and suggested I uploaded 
both the Founder Profile and a Blank Application to Git.

If people want to upload their Applications here and show others for PR or feedback, I'd be happy to add them.

Good luck everybody :)
